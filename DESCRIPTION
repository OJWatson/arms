Description: arms is an R package for simulating the spread of artemisinin 
  resistance in sub-Saharan African context. The package provides tools to 
  simulate how any genetic trait may spread geographically by modelling the 
  spread within regions based on assigned selection coefficients and modelling
  the spread between regions based on rules for how parasites move between 
  regions based on their adjacency or distance and the prevalence of the genetic
  trait in given regions.
